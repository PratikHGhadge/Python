# tuples are similar like list but tuples are immuteable we cant update touple like list
#tuples can store any type of data  example = ('one','two','three')
# no append no insert no remove no pop
example = ('one','two','three')
days = ('monday','tusaday')

#touples are faster than list

# methods
# counts, index, len function, slicing
print(example[:2])
